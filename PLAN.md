## Frontend stack selection process built into Gate 0 (2026-08-03)

### Decision

- `docs/adr/ADR-0005-frontend-stack.md` was changed from a fixed decision (Vue 3 + Inertia.js + Pinia for all projects) to a per-project selection framework within the PHP/Laravel ecosystem (Blade / Livewire / Vue+Inertia+Pinia / React+Inertia / SPA+API), with Vue+Inertia+Pinia kept as the default recommendation.
- The selection process is now an explicit part of Gate 0 (`CLAUDE.md` Step 1a/1b/1c): select stack → record a project ADR via `/adr` → rewrite `.claude/rules/15-frontend.md` for the chosen stack → reflect the result in `docs/ai-context/`.
- `.claude/rules/15-vue.md` was renamed to `.claude/rules/15-frontend.md` so the rule file path stays stable regardless of which stack is selected — projects choosing a non-default stack rewrite this file's contents instead of creating a new file and updating every cross-reference.
- Backend (Laravel + MySQL, ADR-0001/0002) and auth strategy (Sanctum + Policy/Gate, ADR-0003) remain fixed template decisions — out of scope for this flexibility.
